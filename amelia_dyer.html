                  <h2>Early Life</h2>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">Born Amelia Hobley in 1836, she became the youngest of five children in the small town of Pyle Marsh, England, near Bristol. She was educated, developing a love of literature and poetry. Dyer’s mother suffered from mental illness. Dyer had endured a tough childhood in which she witnessed her mother’s violent fits and was the main carer for her until she died in 1848.</p>

                  <h2>Career</h2>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">Dyer first trained as a nurse and by the 1960s, became a baby farmer. Instead of providing a safe and loving home, she would take the child for a fee and viciously murder them in various ways ranging from starving, neglecting to drugging. She would give a cordial to quiet these children as they suffered through starvation.</p>

                     <p style="color:gray;text-align:center;" class="card-text">Dyer began killing her victims by overdosing them with a cordial known as Mother's Friend</p>

                  <br>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">In 1879, a doctor became skeptical about the number of child deaths certified in Dyer’s care. After an investigation, instead of being convicted of murder, however, she was only found guilty of neglect and sentenced to six months of hard labor.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">After her service, she resumed her career as a nurse and baby farmer. Learned from her past conviction, she no longer would notify a doctor and began disposing of the bodies herself by throwing them in the river.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Caught At Last</h2>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">On March 30, 1896, a bargeman noticed a package and fished it from the water. It contained the body of a baby girl, later identified as Helena Fry, with white tape wrapped around her neck. According to her confession, Dyer said that she liked “to watch them with the tape around their neck” and that “was how you could tell it was one of mine.”</p>

                    <img src="dyer_pics/6.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Amelia Dyer">
                    <p style="color:gray" class="card-text">Dyer's victims were strangled with white tape</p>
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">The package was examined and traced back to Mrs. Thomas, one of Dyer’s aliases. She was tried in March 1896. On Wednesday, June 10, 1896, she was hanged for just one murder, but she was suspected of killing hundreds of infants and children.</p>

                     <p style="color:gray" class="card-text">The package found with the body of Helena Fry contained clues which led to Dyer's capture</p>
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">Because the murders occurred at the time of the Jack the Ripper killings, some believe that Amelia Dyer was Jack the Ripper whose victims were botched abortions committed by Dyer.</p>
