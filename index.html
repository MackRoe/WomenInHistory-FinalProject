      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Female serial killers have never gotten the spotlight that the male ones have. Different motives and a completely different style often make them much harder to catch, giving them higher potential lethality. They aren’t prolific, but they are rare cases that garner special attention nonetheless. We aim to highlight the key differences between male and female serial killers, as well as go in-depth on some of the best examples of “she can do it better than him!”

      <h3>The Differences and Simularities</h3>
      <em> by Elaine Music</em><br>
      <p>Usually, when women kill, they are far less brutal in the act than their male counterparts. For they most part, they kill by either poison in most cases, or suffocation. Approximately three quarters of their victims are weak or frail in some way, such as the elderly, the infirm, and small children. On average, one out of every six (less than 15%) serial killers is a woman and kills about six people each. Their motive is most often financial greed. Almost all of them killed people they knew.<br>
      More often than not, when women select victims, it is from a familiar setting such as their home (family members) or their place of employment. Examples of this are the cases of killer care-givers, such as nurse/patient and mother/child killings. While men 'hunt' their victims, women are more likely to 'gather' them from their immediate environment. While there is at least one known exception to this generalization, that case is not the norm.<p>
      <strong>But Why?</strong><br>
        While financial greed is the most obvious motive, studies of female serial killers in the United States, who's crimes occured between 1821 and 2008, revealed other factors. Nearly forty percent of the killers were said to have some form of mental illness. All had experienced high rates of trauma from all forms of abuse. About twenty-five percent had issues with drug or alcohol addiction. However, these evaluations may be skewed by the tendency to minimize negative personality attributes in female offenders.
        <p>
        The psychopathy that leads to committing serial murders by women does not seem to be very well understood. In all known cases, the motivations and mental illness contributing to thier horrific acts, have been evaluated using the same criteria as their male counterparts. This may be a flawed approach due to socially imbued gender role differences. Women are socially conditioned to at least act as if they are empathetic and docile. The severity of their forshadowing anti-social behavior is sometimes downplayed by psychiatric professionals. Some doctors say things about the killers, like "...never really seems to have meant much harm..." or make other such minimalizations. Rather than being labeled as psychopaths, doctors are more likely to diagnose these women with hysteria, aka Histrionic Personality Disorder. (It is important to note that Hysteria is no longer a valid psychiatric diagnosis.) This is perhaps why so few women who commit serial murders are recorded as being psychopathic; 11% for females as opposed to 31% for males. However, female psychopaths show an increased likelyhood for apathy, callousness, and delayed startle response.<p>
            <strong><u>Types</u></strong><p>
            Drawing from the research done for this project, these are the 'types' we've identified:<br>
            <ul><li>Killer Care-Givers</li>
            <li>Team Killers</li>
            <li>Black Widows</li>
            <li>Vengeance Killers</li>
            <li>Mercinary/Money Motives</li>
            <li>Sexual Deviants</li>
        </ul>
